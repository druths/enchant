			<h2>Remote visualization made simple</h2>

			<p>A lot of data science happens on remote servers.  This makes
			visualization a pain. How can we easily capture the plots,
			diagrams, and output of processes - regardless of where they are
			run?</p>
			
			<p>enchant provides a simple, lightweight solution. Imagine a
			virtual space where you could easily push any and all output -
			whether it's images, plots, text, or arbitrary HTML. That's
			enchant.</p>

			<h2>How it works</h2>

			<p><b>The workspace.</b> Your enchant workspace consists of
			notebooks.  You have only one workspace, but you can have as many
			notebooks as you want.</p>
		
			<p><b>The notebook.</b> A notebook is a log of results.  Each
			result is called a <i>block</i>. Every block has a title and a
			timestamp. Put whatever you want into your notebook - text, images,
			HTML. Once it's in, it stays there.  So you can always go back
			through your log and find results that you generated five minutes
			ago, yesterday, or last January.</p>

			<p><b>Posting results.</b> You post new blocks to a notebook using
			either UNIX simple command line programs or programmatic functions:
			
			<blockquote>
				<h4>Command line</h4>
			<pre>$ enchant img ineq_nb \
  "Inequality by decade" \
  ineq_dec.png</pre>

				<h4>Python</h4>
			<pre>send_text('inequality_nb',
          'Basic stats',
          '\n'.join(stats))</pre>
			</blockquote>
			
			Current support for UNIX and
			python are found in the <a
			href="https://github.com/druths/enchant-client">enchant-client</a>
			project.</p>

					</td> <td> <h2>How it compares</h2>
			
			<p><b>enchant vs. files.</b> If you wanted, you could scp images
			and plots from your compute server whenever you generate a new
			result.  But that's a pain - it's slow ... and it doesn't play well
			with long-running jobs. With enchant, you can check up on your
			results from anywhere right on your smartphone!</p>

			<p><b>enchant vs. jupyter.</b> Jupyter and Zepplin are awesome
			interactive notebook. But they have a weird state problem: it's
			hard to know what version of the code in the notebook generated the
			plot you're looking at.  Admittedly, enchant doesn't specifically
			bind results to code.  But by decoupling the result log from the
			code, it becomes less confusing.</p>

			<p><b>enchant vs. a laptop.</b> Sure... you can run all your tasks
			on your laptop.  But many projects will outgrow a desktop - and
			when they do, research results get fragmented.</p>
